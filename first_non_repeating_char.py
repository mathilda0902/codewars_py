# First non-repeating character
# Write a function named firstNonRepeatingLetterâ€  that takes a string input, and
# returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.
#
# For example, if given the input 'stress', the function should return 't',
# since the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.
#
# As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same
# character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter.
# For example, the input 'sTreSS' should return 'T'.
#
# If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return the empty string ("").
